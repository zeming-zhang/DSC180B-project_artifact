Title:
Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations

Abstract:
Working alongside with the intel technology team, our group spent the first quarter and
the winter break collecting many types of user activity data from a PC. We collected the
movement data of a mouse or data which applications users opened. And we collected data of the
foreground window duration, the class and the executive name of the application.With all this
data, we can use them to make further predictions about which application the user will probably
open at a certain time, and for how long on the desktop.
In this project, we first implemented the hidden markov model for predicting the next
application based on the current application opened on the windows. To increase the accuracy,
we predict the next few possible applications instead of just a single one. Furthermore, we
implemented a Long short-term memory method based on the Recurrent neural network model
to predict the total time an application is used in the foreground.
